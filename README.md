Work in progress...


## Development Plan
1. Home page
- Similar with my notion page: https://sunrise-watercress-45f.notion.site/Roo-s-Blog-9f2afac883a24256b2bd91fa66711881
- Add Effort tracker contents to a separate section.
- Add layout
- add summary of all detail pages (highlight, portfolio, resume. developer-notes, effort-tracker)

2. detail page:
- hightlight/{category}/{value}
- portfolio/{category}/{value}
- resume
-- this page should contains all external resources.
- developer-notes/{category}/{value}
- effort-tracker/{category}/{value} 
-- this page contains detail information about effort such as goals, trands, performances, achievements.
