## Development Plan

1. Home page

- Similar with my notion page: https://sunrise-watercress-45f.notion.site/Roo-s-Blog-9f2afac883a24256b2bd91fa66711881
- Add Effort tracker contents to a separate section.
- Add layout
- add summary of all detail pages (highlight, portfolio, resume. developer-notes, effort-tracker)

2. detail page:

- hightlight/{category}/{value}
- portfolio/{category}/{value}
- resume
  -- this page should contains all external resources.
- developer-notes/{category}/{value}
- effort-tracker/{category}/{value}
  -- this page contains detail information about effort such as goals, trands, performances, achievements.
